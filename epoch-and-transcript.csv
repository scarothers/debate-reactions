1399503519,"And good evening. Iêm David Gregory. Welcome to the Maryland Gubernatorial Debate among the Democratic candidates, Lieutenant Government Anthony Brown, Delegate Heather Mizeur and Attorney General Doug Gansler by the University of Maryland, NBC-4 and Bowie State University."1399503537,"This debate is also airing on WAG in Hagerstown, Maryland, Public-- Maryland Public Television and streaming live on NBCWashington.com. I wanna begin by quickly going over the rules of tonightês debate, their rules, the candidatesê debate. The debate will last one hour. Weêll begin with one-minute long opening statements from each candidate. The order has already been determined during a random drawing."1399503560,"Then our panelists and I will pose questions directly to the candidate, these are questions determined by NBC News and-- and NBC-4. The panelists have not reviewed-- the questions, not has the University of Maryland. I am also in the role of time-- the role of time keeper here, Iêve got so many accouterments to help me measure the time, so Iêll be keeping everybody to time."1399503582,"Each candidate is going to have one minute to respond. As moderator, Iêll also be allowed to follow up with questions or-- provide a 30-second rebuttal to the candidates as necessary. Finally, the debate will conclude with closing statements. A time keeper will be located in the front row of the audience, facing the candidates. The time keeper will notify candidates of their remaining time and when time has expired."1399503607,"In the interest of trying to cover as much ground as possible, we ask the candidates to adhere to these time limits; politicians always keep to time, come on. (LAUGH) And-- we also as that the-- the audience listen quietly--no applause, please, over the course of this-- no shouting during the debate."1399503624,"Now I wanna welcome our panelists tonight. Chris Lawrence, whoês a News 4 anchor. Heês spent the last decade covering some of the biggest national stories for CNN before joining the NBC family. Chris is an alumnus of the University of Maryland here at College Park, so a welcome home for him. Chris, welcome."1399503641,Thank you.1399503643,"Jenna Johnson writes about Maryland politics, including the General Assembly, and the 2014 election for The Washington Post. She has been with The Post since 2007. Finally, Chris Gordon, a lawyer; he has been a reporter in this area for almost three decades and for more than 15 years heês covered Maryland politics and legal issues across the state for NBC-4. And now, please welcome the Democratic candidates for governor."1399503668,"The Attorney General of Maryland, Doug Gansler. Maryland State Delegate, Heather Mizeur and Lieutenant Governor, Anthony Brown. Attorney General Gansler, you will be first with your one-min-- one-minute, I should say, opening statement. (MIC NOISE) So the floor is yours."1399503685,"Thank you, David. Thank you the University of Maryland, Bowie State and NBC for hosting us to date this evening. As your governor, I will continue to do what I have done for the past 22 years in public service, and thatês when I see something thatês unfair or wrong, I will fight relentlessly to solve the problem and get things done. Whether itês bringing the Beltway Snipers to justice, arguing in front of the Supreme Court of the United States to keep a child molester behind bars, suing big oil to clean up its spills or preventing big tobacco for marketing-- cigarettes to our children."1399503718,"As your governor, I will give voice to the voiceless, making sure that every Marylander has access to healthcare; creating and strengthening the middle class by creating jobs; taking on the pollution lobbyists so we have clean air and a clean bay, and making sure that in every classroom, we have skilled teachers for every student everywhere in Maryland. You see, I grew up in this state and thereês so much good about this state, but from jobs to healthcare to the environment, we can do so much more. And thatês my (UNINTEL)."1399503755,"And next up, thank you, now up, Delegate Mizeur, your one-minute opening statement."1399503758,"Thank you, David. When I was nine years old, the factory where my father was a union welder went on strike for fair wages. And over the next six months, my family and I struggled to live on $45 a week strike pay. During that period of time, my father took me with him to the picket lines, where I got to see first-hand men and women standing up for what they believe in with incredible courage."1399503783,"I have remembered this my entire time in Annapolis, standing up for Maryland families. Iêve expanded health insurance to 50,000 more children in our state, passed bipartisan legislation to give thousands of low-income women access to free family planning services. And just last month, decriminalized the possession of marijuana. But for all of our successes, there are still too many families who are falling behind in our state. As your governor, I will create jobs with a living wage, reduce that income inequality gap, invest in our schools and drive down violence in our neighbors with a Smart on Crime strategy. Together, we will deliver real results for Maryland families."1399503825,"All right, thank you, Lieutenant Governor, please."1399503829,"Thank you, David, and panelists, sponsors and audience. Good evening. Iêm a generation removed from poverty. My father was raised by his grandmother, my great-grandmother-- in a one-bedroom home on a dirt floor in Kingston, Jamaica, a poor neighborhood called Jonestown."1399503846,"And when my father was a little bit older than my son Jonathan is today, he wrote a letter to his mother, my grandmother, already in this country, he said, –Mom, bring me to America, I wanna be a doctor, I wanna heal people.” She wasnêt a wealthy woman; a woman without an education, but knew the importance of an education. So she saved her money, brought me father, her son to this country, he was the first in our family to get a college education."1399503870,"My father spent a lifetime as a family doctor, treating people and serving people, even those who couldnêt pay for his services. When I grew up, I knew I wanted to be just like my father. I didnêt go to medical school, but I had the privilege to serve our country in the Army, then in the House of Delegates, and for the last eight years as your Lieutenant Governor. Together, we will build a better Maryland for more Marylanders and I look forward to doing that with each and every one of you."1399503896,"All right, thank you all very much. Letês talk about the issues, Iêm gonna start. Healthcare is something that-- Americans are concerned about across the board, especially with the Affordable Care Act. Iêm gonna ask-- this question to three of you in the order that it was designed, so Iêll start with you, Attorney General Gansler-- it is widely-- argued by you and others and believe that the roll out of the healthcare Exchange here was a disaster. Who ultimately is accountable for that? What is the impact of it and how would you fix it?"1399503923,"Well, thank you, David. The-- Lieutenant Governor for a number of years has touted that he is in charge of the Affordable Care Act roll out; and in fact, right now, if you look on his website, it says that Maryland has led the country in the Affordable Care Act roll out."1399503936,"The Washington Post, The Baltimore Sun, Senator Mikulski and many others have called it a national disaster. I think the Lieutenant Governor is the only person that believes itês been a success. Weêre actually 45th in the country in terms of people enrolled, so thatês relatively delusional. We (UNINTEL) $200 million of taxpayer money and (UNINTEL) on the web-- on the website was broken and flushed it down the toilet."1399503958,"And the tragedy is that real people canêt get diabetes screening, healthcare for their children, heart disease medication. And of course-- for somebody to-- to co-chair President Obamaês campaign here in Maryland and-- and went to the United States Supreme Court and had Maryland as the lead plaintiff in the Affordable Care Act Constitutionality, it gives the Republicans a chance to attack our President for doing something no other President was able to do, which is-- make the United States like every other industrial country in the world--"1399503985,"All right, Attorney-- Attorney General--"1399503986,(UNINTEL) citizens.1399503987,youêre out of time. Whoês ultimately responsible? Whoês accountable for this?1399503991,"The-- Lieutenant Governor-- under his own-- under his own recognition. He said, –This is--” the problem is this is, literally, the one thing heês been in charge of, thatês heês managed or heês led since he was Lieutenant Governor and itês been an unmitigated disaster."1399504003,"All right, the Lieutenant Governor will have a moment to respond in full in just a moment when we come to you, but Delegate Mizeur, same question to you-- whoês ultimately accountable for this and what would you do to fix this?"1399504014,"David, Iêm not about casting blame, Iêm about fixing the problem and making sure that families get access to the healthcare that they deserve. I have spent a lifetime making sure that people have access to affordable, quality healthcare. I believe that healthcare is a right, no a privilege. I have been a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act from the beginning, because as a delegate, I have been working in our state for years to get many of those same provisions passed in our state."1399504039,"The first piece of legislation that I passed was a bill that allowed young adults to remain on their familyês health plan until theyêre 25. Thatês now federal law because we showed how it worked in Maryland first. And I learned in passing bills to get 50,000 more children health insurance or getting women access to free family planning services that what matters most is that reforms are implemented effectively."1399504065,"Our ideas and our vision matter in this election, but our records of management matter even more. You want a governor with a successful track record of implementing health reforms, then I am that leader."1399504077,"Okay, Lieutenant Governor, are you ultimately accountable for this?"1399504080,"David, as Iêve said on numerous occasions, everyone involved with establish (PH) in the Health Benefit Exchange is responsible, and that includes me. Iêm not new to healthcare; for the last eight years, we have expanded healthcare to over 500,000 Marylanders who didnêt have access before."1399504097,"So when we set out to implement the Affordable Care Act just like the President, with the difficulties in the federal website and the difficulties they had on the launch, so too, did we in Maryland, and I sincerely regret that any Marylander was inconvenienced, trying to get-- healthcare through the broken website."1399504113,"But nobody was more frustrated than me, and thatês why I took the action that I did. I reorganized the leadership at The Exchange; the Executive Director left. We refocused the vendors, fired those who didnêt perform as promised, including IBM, and after evaluating the resources and capabilities at The Exchange, we plussed up (PH) the call centers and the navigators, and the result, David, 330,000 Marylanders now with access to accordable, quality health--"1399504141,"But lemme follow up on this, you heard the Attorney General say the amount of money that is going to chase after this mistake-- youêre about 50% behind where youêd like to be in getting people enrolled. On the national level, this was an issue in terms of getting those young, healthy people to pay attention, ultimately, and to sign up for something that they think is broken. How do ya deal with that?"1399504159,"Well, l-- letês give it the bench mark first, the bench mark is our goal in Maryland was 260,000, we enrolled 330,000. 260,000 in Medicaid-- now, Medicaidês important, you know-- for better or for worse, you like it or not, in America, Medicaid is the health insurance for the working poor, so weêve expanded health insurance to Marylandês poor and working families, 260,000, but a total of 330,000. So today, in order to ensure that we have a seamless transition for the Open Enrollment in November, weêre adopting proven technology in Connecticut."1399504190,Lemme give 30 seconds to the Attorney General in-- in a rebuttal to this.1399504193,"Well, thereês a couple of things. First of all, the-- the actual number that we know that was-- able to sign up through the website was through Jenna Johnsonês article and the last weêve heard was four people. And that is because thereês been a cover up from the special interests that donêt-- doesnêt want us to know what happens. So what they then did, they went into a closed room and they decided they were going to chase good money after bad and spend another $60 million to get the Connecticut Exchange to come down here and try to retro fit it."1399504218,"Even the Connecticut people say it wonêt work, but we certainly wonêt know if itêll work if we donêt find out what happens in the first place to the $200 million."1399504223,"All right, weêre gonna keep the conversation going with Chris Lawrence, moving onto another topic."1399504229,"Yeah, the-- the decriminalization of marijuana has a lotta people in Maryland wondering, –Whatês the next step?” And if that includes legalizing marijuana. Yet, the governor of one of the most progressive states in this country has recently raised some serious concerns about that issue. Californiaês Jerry Brown, says, quote, –If thereês advertising and legitimacy, how many people can get stoned and still have a great state or a great nation?” But my question to all of you is is the money that the state could get from taxing this drug worth accepting it in Maryland? And Iêd like to begin with Delegate Mizeur."1399504270,"Thank you for the question. Our marijuana prohibition laws have been a failure; they have been enforced with racial bias. African-Americans and whites in our state use marijuana with the exact same frequency, but African-Americans go to jail three times more often."1399504285,"Thatês why I fought for decriminalization in this session. Weêre not putting 23,000 people in jail anymore because of their nonviolent possession of this drug; weêre not spending $280 million a year on the incarceration, detention and court costs associated with this. But if we legalize, tax and regulate marijuana, not only are we bring in a new revenue source that I dedicate to paying for a universal pre-k program, but we would also be sending an importance message about the fact that this is a substance that is arguably less harmful to the body than alcohol and tobacco."1399504321,"And for adults, it should be treated the same way. For youth, we have to step in and make sure they donêt have access. And there are no campaigns to keep-- marijuana out of the hands of our youth. What drug dealer cards for an ID? I have a plan to spend $4 million a year to make sure that young people donêt have access--"1399504339,Lieutenant Governor.1399504339,"Thank you, David. Look, Heather and I agree on a number of issues-- and disagree on-- on probably a fewer number. I donêt agree with-- Delegate Mizeurês call for legalization at this time. I think there are two states that are looking at it. We outta be looking at not just the money, but the socio-economic effects. But I do agree with Del-- Delegate Mizeur in the decriminalization of possession of small amounts of marijuana."1399504364,"We spend over $100 million in this state prosecuting possession of small-- amounts, and that could go to (UNINTEL) and more violent crime. Also, as just pointed out, disproportionately, African-American-- particularly, African-American young men are arrested at higher rates, yet consumption rates are in the same in this country."1399504382,"But I fundamentally disagree with the values of the Attorney General when it comes to rooting out racist practices in the criminal justice system. I oppose the death penalty and I fought long and hard to repeal it in Maryland. The-- the Attorney General supports it, says itês a wonderful tool, he says itês reliable for conviction, but studies have shown itês not reliable. It (UNINTEL) and impacts--"1399504405,All right--1399504404,African-Americans and it doesnêt deter crime.1399504407,"Attorney General, take 30 seconds to respond to that particular point before you answer Chrisês question."1399504412,"Well-- itês curious that he says heês fought for years because every time that a repeal the death penalty bill came up while he was a delegate in Annapolis, other delegates signed up to sponsor the bill and-- the Lieutenant Governor was nowhere to be found until he was running for governor."1399504425,"The death penalty is a lot like prohibition; itês-- itês not-- itês a non-issue in this-- campaign, it-- the General Assembly has repealed it, the public has spoken on it. When I-- Iêve been a prosecutor for 22 years and I never sought the death penalty once."1399504437,"So letês talk about marijuana, then, and itês--"1399504440,"So as-- as-- as a former Assistant United States Attorney in the Clinton Administration-- Stateês Attorney, Montgomery Attorney, now Attorney General, I understand the-- the ravages that drugs do cause families and-- the addictions and what they do to people."1399504453,"I happen to agree that-- medical marijuana is-- is something we should allow-- to have, as long as itês being prescribed by real doctors. And decriminalization is-- is someplace we should have gone. I donêt think, though, and I agree with the Lieutenant Governor, that we should go to legalization right now."1399504469,"Former Attorney General-- Brown of California is-- is right. We have to make sure we allow some of these states, to see (UNINTEL) how it works. Marijuana hasnêt been legal-- for hundreds of years, letês see how it works. Thereês no rush-- iron out any of the problems, but we shouldnêt be motivated by taxes when we do it. We should make sure that we-- if we are gonna legalize marijuana, and hopefully, that wonêt happen for a long time, we do it in lock step with public safety officials and public health officials because-- we shouldnêt be motivated by having yet another tax-- on a product. Now I can say, the decriminalization is for such small amounts that very few people are locked up on that at all--"1399504503,"And Delegate Mizeur, just a final 30 seconds on this. With legalization in your views, are you comfortable saying to the children of this state, –Marijuanaês okay”?"1399504514,"Weêre not saying that to the children of this state. To the children of this state, weêre saying that itês a very dangerous substance for a developing mind, and weêre gonna spend $4 million a year to make sure that they understand that. But what drug dealer is carding for an ID right now? Thatês how kids are getting access."1399504529,"And when we legalize, tax and regulate it, the stateês in charge of this. And the same way we do with alcohol, we improve our chances of keeping it out of the hands of our youth. The Institute of Medicine actually said that the-- the gateway drug theory is about the drug-- about marijuana being prohibited, that the laws against it are what actually has young people having more access."1399504552,To Chris Gordon now.1399504554,"There is a perception that Maryland is not business friendly, you may have heard it. I have on the street. And-- there are four Republican candidates running for the same job you are who say that taxes have been raised and created dozens and dozens of times in the last seven years of this administration and theyêre gonna blame Democratic lawmakers. So my question to-- in fact, they wanna reduce or do away with some of those taxes. So would you lower or raise taxes and how do you attract business and new jobs to the state?"1399504588,Lieutenant?1399504590,Lieutenant Governor Brown.1399504590,"Look, Iêm traveled around the-- state-- and spoken with business leaders from all four corners, there is concern about the business climate in Maryland and I rolled out a proposal to position Maryland to be the most competitive business climate state in the nation. Part of itês looking at regulations and licensing, and part of it is looking at our tax liability. Look, in the first 100 days of the Brown-Ulman Campaign, we are going to put together a Blue Ribbon Commission to look at tax reform."1399504617,"Weêre gonna make sure that weêre giving a (UNINTEL) to working families, that weêre incentivizing employers to invest in job-creating activities in Maryland and that weêre protecting our investments in education, public safety, the environment and healthcare."1399504630,"But my tax plan will not include and it doesnêt, the corporate giveaway under the Gansler Corporate Tax giveaway. If weêre gonna invest in education, if weêre gonna invest in transportation, we canêt afford to give a small number of the largest corporations in Maryland a $1.6 billion tax giveaway. Itês under that plan that Doug has said we canêt fund pre-k education for all Maryland four-year-olds. Thatês not my thing--"1399504652,"Time. So the-- so the Attorney General, the-- the same question."1399504657,"Thank you, Chris. Itês not a perception; itês a reality. We have had 40 consecutive tax increases here in Maryland. The people of Maryland just canêt take it anymore. We got 76% more people unemployed than when Lieutenant Governor came to power-- when heês been at the seat of power-- and stood by when all this was happening to our state."1399504675,"In Baltimore City, 46% of the adult males donêt have work; weêve lost over 7,000 small businesses in the last eight years. Weêre 43rd in the country in manufacturing and we only have four Fortune 500 companies left here in Maryland. This is one of the richest states and one of the smartest states in the country in terms of advanced degrees. So we cannot continue to mortgage the economic viability of the future of this state on the backs of casino gambling and more tax increases. We need to bring life science companies here, cyber security companies here."1399504705,"We need to look at what New York has done in terms of manufacturing-- having tax-free incentives to manufacturing, so people can once again get back to work in the state of Maryland. Because we canêt continue to have half a billion and do billion-dollar deficits every year in Annapolis."1399504718,"Iêm the only one on this stage that has owned a small business and Iêm the only one with a plan to help them grow. I have a different vision about our economy, one that doesnêt pit workers against businesses. My job creation strategy includes something for us all. If we were to bring back the Millionairesê Tax and close one corporate tax loophole that allows a handful of companies in our state that operate in other states, who are avoiding paying their fair share of Maryland taxes-- just ask them to pay their fair share."1399504748,"We could generate enough revenue to give 90% of all Maryland families a tax cut and tax relief for all of our small businesses. If we put more money in the hands of middle class families, what do they do? They spend it in the economy; they go out to eat at more restaurants; they buy more shoes for their children and school supplies. And I have a plan to put people to work, rebuilding our roads, our transit and building 21st century schools."1399504775,"All right. Violent crime is down across the state, except for one category, forcible rape. In 2012, more than 1200 people reported being raped in Maryland, and advocates say even more cases go unreported. The Obama Administration has launched several initiatives aimed at reducing and combating sexual violence in the military and on college campuses. What will you do here in Maryland to address sexual violence? And Attorney General, weêll start with you."1399504810,"Thank you. Weêre actually-- the ninth most violent state in the country, Baltimore Cityês the seventh most violent city in the country and we have the fourth most homicides in the country here in Maryland, so we have a lot of work to do. In terms of rape-- let me talk about Hollis Church (PH) for a moment."1399504826,"She was raped while watching television in Kensington one night; 13 years later-- I was able to personally go into court and prosecute the offender because-- we had a DNA hit from Virginia. We then went to the Supreme Court of the United States when I was Attorney General and made sure we upheld the DNA statues, and law enforcement could use DNA to solve on-- cold case rape cases."1399504847,"So we do have an issue here in Maryland, and we need to do a lot more in terms of our crime prevention and-- and going forward. We have-- community prosecution-- we need-- to make sure that we-- a lot of the rapes actually happened in domestic violence situations, and I started the first domestic violence court in-- in Montgomery County and we wanna have domestic violence courts all over the state when Iêm governor."1399504870,Delegate Mizeur.1399504872,"Any woman who is faced rape or domestic violence deserves to know that she has a governor and the law on her side. I have been pushing to erase the backlog of rape kits that are sitting in our criminal justice system. I have a plan to make sure that we remove guns from the scenes of domestic violence disputes, because we know that women are five times more likely to be hurt, harmed, killed, even, when their abuser has a firearm in the home."1399504901,"And Iêve been pushing for a paid sick leave that includes time off for safe time, for women who need to interact with the criminal justice system, work to get a restraining order or meet with an attorney to get the protection that she needs."1399504913,"We have to make sure that we protect and empower women, that we bring their abusers to justice and that we do everything we can to make sure that this violence isnêt repeated again. Iêll be the governor that helps get this done."1399504926,Lieutenant Governor?1399504929,"Now weêll build stronger communities and a foundation of stronger families when our wives, our mothers, our sisters and our daughters can live free of the fear of sexual assault, rape and domestic violence in the home, in the neighborhood and in the workplace. No familyês immune from that type of violence. My cousin, Kathy, was killed at the hands of her estranged boyfriend."1399504951,"And since that time, and even before, Iêve worked with the advocates of domestic violence. Weêve increased the number of domestic violence referral programs and sexual assault (UNINTEL) at our community hospitals from four to nine, and my goal is to reach every one of the 43 community hospitals in the state of Maryland."1399504970,"Together, weêve done a lot of work to reduce domestic violence against women, to make this a safer state for w-- for women. Weêve-- given judges the authority to order domestic abusers to surrender their firearms. This year, finally, after 19 years of failed effort, we lowered the standard and a woman can now get a protective order on a preponderance of the evidence standard, instead of the heightened clear and convincing standard."1399504991,All right.1399504993,"So weêre making a lot of progress, we have a lot more work to do."1399504995,Back to Chris Gordon.1399504996,"All right, this question-- deals with character, leadership and fitness for office. Youêve all had public service; we thank you for that. And Iêm gonna ask you each an individual question to answer here. Attorney General Gansler, your judgment has been questioned. With the pictures that we have seen from the party you attended-- your son was at, what may have been underage drinking and you said you did nothing to stop it, it was not in Maryland, it was in Delaware. But with your-- statements-- military service, you implied, was not-- a real job."1399505030,"And with your use of the state car, a report being that you asked your state (UNINTEL) to go through red lights or-- up-- the shoulder of a road to get to-- to an appointment on time. Lieutenant Governor Brown, we have heard tonight that you botched the roll out, and in fact, the Attorney General used the word –cover up” tonight."1399505048,"And-- Delegate Mizeur-- critics say that youêre just not experienced enough because youêve been a state delegate since 2007, but youêve never had state-wide elected office or experience as an executive. How do you all answer these critics? Delegate Mizeur, we start with you."1399505068,"Marylanders want a governor who knows how to bring people together to get big things done. Lemme tell ya two stories about the way Iêve done this, on family planning and marijuana decriminalization. I reached across the aisle to work with the head of the Tea Party Caucus to expand family planning services to low-income women, by first convincing him that it lowered the abortion rate and saved the state money."1399505088,"It also happens to be good for maternal and child health outcomes. Together we put partisanship on the shelf in order to make progress for our state. 34,000 more women have access to free family planning services in our state because of this."1399505102,"This year in the legislative session, which is 48 hours to go, the press all reported that our marijuana decriminalization effort was dead, it had got vote-- voted out of a committee and turned into a study (PH) bill. I worked with the legislative Black Caucus and a group of progressive legislators to come up with a strategy on the floor to turn that around. We passed that law, sent it to the Governorês desk, Maryland is now the 18th state to decriminalize marijuana. Both of these happened because of leadership."1399505130,Time.1399505130,Iêm the governor that this state is ready for.1399505132,"Lieutenant-- Lieutenant Governor, what about the-- the criticism? Your--"1399505135,Sure--1399505136,leadership-- the-- the fitness question.1399505139,"Sure, as governor, I would bring not only eight years of experience as Lieutenant Governor, but eight years in the General Assembly and 30 years in uniform and service to our country. As Lieutenant Governor-- during the last eight years, I led the effort on (UNINTEL) closure-- that is all ready today created or brought to our state 49,000 jobs and we are well on our way to meeting the goal of 60,000 jobs by 2022."1399505166,"Reduce violence against women and children and the work weêre doing on domestic violence, that Iêve had the opportunity to lead and work with so many on. Weêve reduced a number of children in foster care-- from-- 9,069-- Iêve led on that effort, as well as the work weêve done to serve our veterans."1399505180,"Marylanders have a choice; theyêre gonna look at experience, theyêre gonna look at record and theyêre gonna look at judgment. Not only, Chris, the things that you offered up for the Attorney General, but also the fact that he was the only Stateês Attorney in the history of Maryland reprimanded by the highest court for misconduct, ethical misconduct in office because he denied a defendant the right to a fair trial because he, for political gain, spoke out."1399505202,Time.1399505203,"Thatês judgment, voters are gonna be (UNINTEL) that."1399505206,"Attorney General, you can respond to that, as well as the question that Chris originally posed."1399505209,So the-- the reprimand?1399505210,"If youêd like, yes, you could just--"1399505211,"Yeah-- yes, I have the honor of being reprimanded by the Court of Appeals because I took on a judge who said to an 11-year-old girl who was raped by a sexual Internet predator that it takes two to tango and that it was her fault for responding to his emails, which is why he went and raped her. The Court of Appeals then reprimanded me-- for being a public official publicly reading a public charging document at a press conference with the police. I-- I wear it as a badge of honor."1399505236,"As far as character, I think my character stands for itself. Iêve been in public office for 22 years representing-- the-- the victims of crime, I-- Iêve taken on cases, for example, Garret Wilson, who murdered both of his babies in the 1980s and they were ruled as SIDS death."1399505252,"Nobody else would prosecute that case, I did, and heês spending the rest of his life behind bars. There were children in Baltimore City who didnêt have access to the same things the rest of Maryland did to be able to play lacrosse. So six years ago, I started-- I cared about them, so I started a league called (UNINTEL) Youth Lacrosse. We have over 400 boys and girls in that league right now that are all prospering and being able to go to better schools and-- and being active in their communities. Lemme talk about the beach party because--"1399505278,"Well-- well, youêre-- youêre over on your time, but Iêm gonna ask you-- you have (UNINTEL) Iêm gonna ask you about that. Did you miss an opportunity, as the Attorney General of the state to deal as the Attorney General with underage drinking? Did you miss an opportunity as a parent to step into that situation and not put blinders on, but deal with it more responsibly?"1399505299,"So my wife and I have been married for 22 years. We are profoundly proud of our children. That night, I went to tell my child what time he was going to leave-- the next morning. Could we-- could I have done something different there that night? Absolutely."1399505310,"Well, will we say things to our children or do things in the future that we could do differently? Absolutely. As a matter of fact, a few weeks later, I took him to college at-- at Penn, and is there underage drinking at college? Absolutely. Iêm not gonna not send him to college, but we worry. We parent on the fly. And-- and that is-- that was the mistake we made that night. In terms of Attorney General, Iêd-- Iêd rather mention to taking caffeinated alcohol beverages off the shelf."1399505333,"All right. All right, we are gonna leave it there for a moment. We are gonna take a break here. Take a pause for a brief commercial break. Weêll be right back with many more questions for the candidates for Governor of Maryland. And after the debate, join me for a special Google Hangout on NBCWashington.com. Weêll be right back. (MUSIC)"1399505528,"And we are back, live at the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center at the University of Maryland with three Democratic candidates for Governor of Maryland. Attorney General, Doug Gansler, Delegate Heather Mizeur and Lieutenant Governor, Anthony Brown. Before we move back to the panel, I wanted to stay for a moment, Lieutenant Governor, on-- on this leadership and character question. You heard the Attorney General respond to questions about that beach party. Firstly, is that a character issue for-- for you in this race? And secondly, how did you respond to his-- his comment about your military record?"1399505558,"Well, I think itês a judgment issue, and the set of rules that apply to the public apply to us. If-- if it was one thing, if it were, perhaps, in your own living room with your children, but months earlier, you looked into the camera, you told parents what we know. We are the role models to discourage underage drinking. You did a public service announcement, but then found yourself in the middle of not one, two or three, but literally, hundreds of teenagers underage drinking. And what I would have done as a parent, (MIC NOISE) and I, too, am a parent, my 19-year-old daughterês sitting (LAUGH) right here in the audience."1399505591,Okay.1399505593,I would have stopped the party and made sure that every child got home safely.1399505596,"Well, as much as I appreciate the Lieutenant Governor-- lecturing me on my parenting skills, I would like to talk about the military question that you just asked. To be clear, I did not say one derogatory syllable to any one of our veterans."1399505608,"Like everybody watching at home and everybody here, I have the deepest respect for our-- our veterans and a profound depth of g-- depth of gratitude toward them, but we can do so much more for our veterans in Maryland. In eight years, we havenêt stepped up. We could get them P.T.S.D. counseling; we have the worst Veterans Administration office in the country here in Maryland, and we need to make sure that we donêt tax the-- the retirement income here in Maryland."1399505631,"Quickly, Lieutenant Governor, respond to that, since you were the--"1399505634,"You canêt build a strong Maryland if you keep cutting it down. And right now, we have an honorable veteran community that is well served by the Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs. These are veterans that are serving veterans. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, the work that weêre doing to connecting them to jobs. Weêre proud of the work that we do and weêre proud of the service that they perform both here in the community and wherein-- in service. Whether youêre a cook, a clerk, a lawyer-- a pilot or anything else in the military, we value your service to our-- to our nation."1399505668,"Delegate, since youêre here, lemme give you 30 seconds on this issue."1399505670,"David, you asked about leadership and character. I donêt think itês about this kind of personal bickering and attacks. Voters are wanting candidates to remain positive and stay focused on the issues. Leadership and character that we need in Annapolis is a governor that will take on the special interests and fight for middle class families. And that is who I am, thatês who Iêve always been and thatês what you can expect me to do as your governor."1399505691,"All right, Jenna, back to you."1399505694,"So we recently heard a recording that was reportedly the owner of the LA Clippers making racist comments. The NBA has since banned him for life, and President Obama responded by saying, quote, –We constantly have to be on guard on racial attitudes that divide us, rather than embracing our div-- diversity as a strength.” Here in Maryland, the owner of the Red Skins has said that the team name celebrates Native American culture, while others have said itês an offensive racial slur. Is it a slur and should it be changed? And Lieutenant Governor, weêll start with you."1399505732,"Sure. First of all, let me say that-- what the NBA-- did-- in response to the comment by the owner of-- the LA Clippers was-- appropriate-- and it sent a strong signal, that those words, that action is unacceptable. I no longer refer to Washingtonês football team by their nickname."1399505750,"I do find it-- offensive and I would hope that-- the owner, Dan Snyder-- would reach the same conclusion-- and to change the name. I know, I believe that the fan base-- is-- wants the same thing. But-- more importantly-- if weêre going to live up to the kind of Maryland that we can all be proud of, then we have to synchronize our words, our actions, okay? And Dan Snyder, if his football team, particularly, is playing in Maryland, he outta-- he outta synchronize his conscience, his actions and do the right thing and change the name."1399505786,Attorney General?1399505789,Thank you. I started the first civil rights division in our stateês history-- in the Attorney Generalês Office. Weêve taken on the minority achievement gap and higher education. Weêre obviously-- Iêm extremely concerned about the lack of funding for our HBCUs here in Maryland.1399505803,"Weêve addressed voting rights issues. Some-- Iêm keenly aware of this issue-- involving civil rights and people that feel discriminated against. You know, in terms of the Red Skins-- Iêve been a life-long Red Skins fan, I do a show every week before the game for the Red Skins, and I am sympathetic to-- those fans that deeply love the name and understand that it wasnêt intended as a slur. But it is."1399505825,"And so, we-- we should move towards changing the name away from the Red Skins because people find it offensive. We change the name of the (UNINTEL) when-- when they-- when people found that offensive, and look at tonight, the Wizards are playing right up against this debate, and hopefully, theyêre winning. And so-- (LAUGHTER) and-- and so, we can change the name and move on, and I think that if-- if people are offended by it, we actually should change the name, and the Red Skinsê-- owners will make a lot more money by selling-- throwback jerseys and the like."1399505850,"If they donêt, though, if-- if you were governor of this state, would you pursue some recourse to put pressure on the team to do it, pressure on the NFL to do it?"1399505858,"No, I think no. I-- I think I would-- I would meet with-- Mr. Snyder and-- and people from the Red Skins organization and try and come to an understanding. I think theyêre going to change the name, I think that the-- dye is-- is cast and I think theyêre gonna change the name. The question is when and how."1399505873,Delegate Mizeur?1399505876,"Words matter, and I am opposed to the name of the Washington Red Skins, and Iêve made that clear over the course of this election. But our actions matter even more. Letês talk about the income inequality that exists in our state. We raised the minimum wage this year, but it was so watered down by the time we pushed it through, that the next governor will be running for reelection before it even gets the tin tin (PH). And we didnêt include provision that indexed it for inflation or addressed the problem of our tipped workers, still only earning $3.63 an hour. Many of those workers are women and people of color."1399505912,"If you look at our gender pay gap in this state, women are still making, on average, $.85 on the dollar to their male counterparts. But if youêre an African-American woman, thatês $.67. If youêre a Latina woman, itês $.46. This is an issue of urgency that demands a governor that cares about these issues and will fight to address the income inequality gap that has plans to provide minimum wage-- relief. I-- I wanna not just have a minimum wage--"1399505939,Time.1399505940,I wanna have a living wage. And Iêm the only candidate up here that has put that policy on the table.1399505944,To Chris Lawrence.1399505945,"As a father of two very young children, I wanna ask a question about schools, which itês something thatês very, very important to a lotta Maryland moms and Maryland dads out there. Just down the road from here, Montgomery Countyês enrollment has grown by about 15,000 students just since the year 2000."1399505966,"The county educates more than 17% of Marylandês students, and yet, it only received about 11% of school construction funds. My question is: Will you work to change the current funding mechanism for Maryland (MIC NOISE) schools to steer more money to Montgomery County? And letês start with Delegate Mizeur."1399505987,"Thank you for the question, itês a really critical one. I got involved in this issue three years ago as Vice Chair of Education and Economic Development for our Appropriations Committee. And I was touring schools in Baltimore City. I was in Holabird Academy and I was devastated by what I saw. (NOISE) Fountains that the kids canêt drink out of because theyêre lead piped-- theyêre too cold in their-- rooms with-- coats taking their exams because the heat doesnêt work."1399506013,"Iêve seen prison conditions better than these schools. And I coulda come home to Montgomery County and said, –Thatês Baltimoreês problem.” But I recognized that Baltimoreês problem was the most acute-- $3 billion problem of what is a $15 billion crisis for the entire state."1399506029,"We had to fix it in Baltimore first before we could fix it anywhere else, and I was-- (MIC NOISE) really proud to be involved in getting that first round of funding put together. Itês a model we can use to bring funding to Montgomery County, Baltimore County and Prince Georgeês County, which we fought to get done this legislative session. And as governor, Iêll get it done. I have a plan in my jobs and economic development plan that has two more ideas on how we can get that money. (LAUGHTER) Youêll have to read about it on my website."1399506059,Whoês up next on it?1399506060,"It should be the-- Attorney General, Mr. Brown, (UNINTEL). Lieutenant Governor, excuse me. Yeah."1399506066,"Okay-- time. (LAUGHTER) Look, we-- over the last seven years, we built, according to Education Week Magazine, some of the best schools in the nation. We rank number one. But I think everyone understands and believes that Iêm cert-- certainly committed to ensuring that every child, whether youêre educated in Bethesda, Chevy Chase or in Baltimore City, has access to a world class education in a modern technology-ready classroom. Thatês why over the last eight years, weêve increased investments in school construction at a high water mark of $400 million, an average of $340 million a year. Thatês not enough. I put forward a plan in December, so over the next four years, we will increase that average to $500 million a year."1399506112,"Iêm committed to working with the-- local leadership in Montgomery County to do exactly what we did in Baltimore County. We authorized a $1.1 billion school construction program to get those children out of the second oldest set of schools in the state. We can do that; we have the resources in Maryland. Itês not gonna be easy. We have to set our priorities. In a Brown-Ulman Administration, schools are a top priority."1399506137,So the Attorney General.1399506138,"I grew up in Montgomery County, I-- Iêm a proud graduate of the Chevy Chase Elementary School. My-- my family lives in Montgomery County, so I actually know what Montgomery County is like, and itês not like-- much of what the state believes it to be like. Weêre a majority/minority-- county; we have 166 languages spoken in our schools. And to your question, we are-- woefully underfunded. Baltimore City needed new schools, and they got-- they got a billion dollars towards that."1399506163,"But Montgomery County, Prince Georgeês County and Baltimore County deserved to have new schools, too. But not only that, the Lieutenant Governorês been in office for eight years, at the s-- at the seat of power, and stood by while Maryland has the number two-- number two minority achievement in the country, the second-worst."1399506181,"And thatês the moral state of our state. So we need to address that. I was the first candidate to come out for expanding pre-k for all people in Maryland, particularly, starting with people 300% above the poverty line or below. We want-- but we also have to make sure we have skilled teachers, like in any other profession, reward the-- the people who are more astute (PH), which is our teachers."1399506201,"Time. Lieutenant Governor, take 30 seconds for a rebuttal."1399506202,"Thank you 30 seconds. Maryland leads the nation when it comes to reducing the achievement gap by income and we have work to do. Our students of color are making the greatest progress in 4th grade and 8th grade math and reading; we still have an achievement gap to close, thatês why I have a plan."1399506216,"Doug, you talk about a moral stain in education achievement gap, if we pass the Gansler Corporate Tax Giveaway, that moral stain will become an indelible blemish, as generations of students will not have access to early childhood education, which is proven to be one of the best ways to eliminate the achievement gap in--"1399506234,"Attorney General, take 30 seconds to--"1399506236,"President Obama-- Congressman Van-- Van Hollen, Congressman Hoyer all are for reducing the corporate tax. The prob-- the-- one of the reasons why weêre losing so many of our companies to Virginia is because we have an eight and a quarter-- corporate tax (UNINTEL) at 6%."1399506249,"I was an Economics major Yale, I get that people operate on the best interests. If we-- reduce the corporate tax by a quarter of a point each year, more jobs will come, our tax base will be en-- enhanced, and weêll be able to do things like fix the schools, where-- where we have this minority achievement gap. So I-- you know, we do need-- and I agree with Heather Mizeur, we need to close that corporate loophole for the big companies."1399506271,Let me go back to Chris.1399506272,"Call this the legacy question. The current governor, Martin OêMalley, had a very progressive list of priorities and passed most of them, if not all of them. The Green Act, lowering-- and making in-state tuition for the children of illegal immigrants. Same-sex marriage, abolishing the death penalty, tough gun control laws."1399506293,"And this session, is top priority, raising the minimum wage. So my question to each of you is, whatês the next big idea that you have? What would be your legacy, if elected governor of Maryland? And we start with-- Delegate Mizeur."1399506307,"Actually, weêre gonna start with the Attorney General. Weêre-- weêre watching this closely. So the Attorney General will speak next."1399506311,"Thanks for noticing. I was five years ahead of most people on the issue of marriage equality; I went down and testified on it before anybody else-- thought it was a good idea. They literally tried to impeach me in Annapolis, and-- of course, my wife was hoping they would be successful so I could get a real job, here I am again-- Attorney General running for yet a new job."1399506330,I then wrote an opinion recognizing out-of-state same-sex marriages here in Maryland because I thought it was the right thing to do and I didnêt think people should be discriminated against. I then was the first person on the stage to come out for increasing the minimum wage. Itês just not fair.1399506345,"If youêre making $7.25 an hour working 40 hours a week and youêre still under the federal poverty line, thatês just not right. So we need to-- I think the next thing we need to do is bring jobs back to Maryland. We cannot sustain this. Thereês too many poor people. When you have 46% of the people in-- Baltimore-- going-- men out of work, thatês wrong. And the second is dealing with re-entry. Taking prisoners-- from behind bars and making them tax-paying citizens."1399506370,Delegate Mizeur?1399506373,"Thank you. I have a plan to make sure that we donêt just have a minimum wage in this stage, we have-- a living wage, •cause no one should be working 40 hours a week and still be living in poverty. I have a plan to make sure that we address (NOISE) that achievement gap that we discussed earlier."1399506391,"It still matters in Maryland what your socio-economic status is and what your race is to determine whether or not youêre gonna be successful in school. And we know it doesnêt have to be that way. When we invest in early childhood initiatives from birth to age five, we eliminate that disparity and give every child a chance to enter school ready to learn at the same pace."1399506409,"My plan to address this is comprehensive. Itês a universal pre-k plan, not just for four-year-olds, not just for four-year-olds from some low-income families, all of our four-year-olds, and weêll cover a half day for three-year-olds, as well."1399506421,"And weêll also provide childcare subsidies, not just for low-income families, who have a long waiting list to get access to care, but for middle class families, as well, because our children need access to a quality, affordable, nurturing educational environment before they get into pre-k."1399506435,Lieutenant Governor.1399506437,"Thank you, Chris. We live in a much more just society today than we did eight years ago. Passed marriage equality, and-- and the Dream Act. We passed some of the most stringent gun safety measures in the wake of Newtown, Connecticut and we repealed the death penalty. I believe that the greatest challenge that we face as a state and as a nation, is to address the persistent, debilitating gaps, disparities and inequities that exist in our economy, in our society, in our community and yes, in our classrooms."1399506472,"And thatês why Iêve got a plan to create more jobs in Maryland, but not only create more jobs by investments and infrastructure and renewable energy, but to educate and train all of Marylandês workforce so they can compete s-- successfully for that. At the end of my four-year term, I hope that we can look back in Maryland and say, –We have career technology education in every high school or every county,” so that weêre not only preparing students--"1399506497,Time.1399506499,"who want to go to college, but those who donêt so that they are ready to enter the workplace and support their"1399506504,Final-- final question here from Chris.1399506507,"I wanna talk a little bit about something that you all have brought up. Governor OêMalley has signed off on about 40 new taxes since he took office, and yet, the number of Maryland families who need government help to make ends meet has reached record levels. And this is a very simple question: Would you raise taxes to cover the cost of continuing this level of government assistance? And I believe we go to the Lieutenant Governor first."1399506536,"Thank you. So I think the good news is, I-- I donêt see the need in the foreseeable future to have to raise taxes in Maryland. Weêve got the resources and the revenues to take on the tough challenges ahead, to fully fund education, to continue to drive down crime in neighborhoods throughout the state. I do believe that we ought to engage, as I said earlier, in comprehensive tax reform."1399506560,"Look, Maryland and America still has a level of poverty that is higher than it was when Doctor King when was waging the war against poverty in the 1960s with Lyndon Johnson, President Johnson. Thatês why weêve invested in Medicaid; thatês why weêve taken on a strategic goal to end childhood hunger; thatês why weêve expanded affordable housing."1399506581,"And Iêve got a plan to deliver even more affordable housing. Yeah, there are more demands, but Marylandês a great state and Maryland can be better for more Marylanders, if we apply our resources, effectively wisely in a socially prudent and fiscally responsible way."1399506595,Attorney General?1399506597,(UNINTEL) 40 straight taxes; people canêt take it anymore. Thereês been a recent poll by Gallup that says 40% of Marylanders want to leave this state because of the tax burden and the economic hardship that we face. We need to actually bring jobs back.1399506611,"We need to focus on the fact that we are the only state in the country that has NIH and Johnês Hopkins, number one hospital in-- in the country, as well as the University of Maryland Medical System. We need to focus on the fact that we have a Citer (PH) Command Center and the NSA here and we have the smartest people in the country in terms of the advanced degrees, yet, we donêt leverage that. And we need to bring manufacturing back to Maryland and we need to br-- make sure that Prince Georgeês Countyês economic development-- around its (UNINTEL) and development, because if we donêt have jobs, weêre gonna continue to have poor people."1399506639,"Thereês nowhere to go. And so, one of the things that we want to do is when youêre 16 years old, thereês some people that-- wanna get a job, that donêt wanna stay in school till theyêre 18 and go the traditional path. So theyêll have-- an ability to do a career and vocational and career apprenticeship where they can go-- in the afternoons and start-- and get certified (UNINTEL) to get a job."1399506657,Time. Delegate Mizeur.1399506661,"Being governor is about setting priorities and building budgets around it. Itês about revenues in and expenditures out. By decriminalizing marijuana, weêve created another $280 million in savings in our budget. By legalizing and taxing it, we create another $160 million. When we close the corporate tax loophole, the-- the handful of companies that are abusing right now, $200 million extra in our state."1399506685,"Bring back the Millionairesê Tax, another $112 million, and what do you get for that? A universal pre-k program, tax cuts for small businesses and 90% of all Maryland families get middle class tax relief they have been begging for in this state. These are my priorities and this is exactly how I will pay for them as your governor."1399506704,"All right. The closing statements. Delegate Mizeur, youêre gonna begin. You each have a minute. Please stick to time, weêre tight on it. Go ahead."1399506712,"I see it in living rooms and community centers all across this state. Voters want candidates who remain positive, who are focused on the policy and not platitudes, who remember that weêre always going to be stronger when we put our common good ahead of the priorities of special interests and-- and people who have extra access in Annapolis."1399506737,"Iêm a governor that wants to make sure Maryland works for all of our-- citizens. I will invest in infrastructure needs for our state, make sure that our schools are great in every corner, reduce crime in our neighborhoods and turn our minimum wage into a living wage."1399506754,"And for the women watching tonight, I know that for too long, the inequalities in our schools, in our pay and in our economy have existed for too long. It doesnêt have to be this way. I know what it takes to make Maryland work and be fair--"1399506773,All right.1399506773,[nothing]1399506776,"All right, Lieutenant Governor, please."1399506778,"Thank you, David. Over the last eight years, we-- and I say –we” collectively, have made tremendous progress as a state. We have built the best in the nation, public schools, but we know that not every childês educated in a Blue Ribbon school today."1399506792,"So our work continues. Weêve not only driven the crime down to the lowest levels weêve seen in three decades, but weêve reduced recidivism and our inmate population is smaller today than it was six years ago. Weêre one of only a handful of states that weathered the great recession with a AAA bond rating, we recovered jobs at a rate faster than every state in the mid-Atlantic, with an unemployment rate one full percent below the national average. But we know that there continue to be Marylanders who are unemployed and underemployed. Thatês why Iêve gotta plan. And I ask ya to go to AnthonyBrown.com, because in this hour, we didnêt discuss all of it."1399506827,"Iêve got a five-point plan to create jobs, Iêve got a plan to deliver universal pre-k to every Maryland four-year-old, greater investments in career technology education and school construction, but I need you. I need you to help me and Ken Ulman build a better Maryland for more Marylanders."1399506842,"The Attorney General, closing (UNINTEL)."1399506844,"Youêve heard a lot of back and forth this evening, and I wanna end by sharing what motivates me. Because during a political campaign, that does and can get distorted. Like you, my family motivates and defines me. Laura and I have been married for 22 years, weêre profoundly proud of our children, weêre incredibly devoted and involved parents, and we-- I want them to be proud of our public service. And-- and many families out there, you also motivate me, all the families I see around the state of Maryland."1399506874,"Because we have taken on judges-- because of that. We are-- I have mentored inner city kids when the system was left behind. Iêve taken on polluters-- cyber bullying, Internet fraud and Internet crime. And when Iêm governor, we will-- we will deliver the promise of healthcare reform, because healthcare is a right."1399506894,"So I just wanna leave you with one thought, if-- if thereês one thought you can be left with, which is this: I will always stand up against the special interests, because your fight is my fight."1399506904,"And we will leave it there. Thank you all very much. Thank you to our partners, University of Maryland, NBC-4, Bowie State University (APPLAUSE). (MUSIC)"
